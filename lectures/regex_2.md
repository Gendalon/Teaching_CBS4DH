## Excercise with data from Wikipedia

In this excercise we'll take data from Wikipedia and make a csv file out of it by using regular expressions for searching and replacing.

* You'll need [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* First go to  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011 (we'll work with a German text)
* Click on "Quelltext bearbeiten"
* What you see there is the Wikipedia markdown format
* Copy the section "Auswahl bekannter Verstorbener" into a plain text file
* In Atom you can now use regular expressions for converting that list into a csv file like [this one](../exercise/lecture3/data.csv)
