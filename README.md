Main topics covered:

- Use of command line
- Introduction to regular expressions
- Practical use of Git
- Some notes on file formats
- Minimal introduction to web technologies

Given its practical nature, students are required to bring a laptop computer (no tablets!). If this presents a problem, please contact one of the course instructors in advance.
